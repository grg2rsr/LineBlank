# LineBlank
Code for temporally interlacing visual stimulus presentation or optogenetic stimulation during a multiphoton scanning microscopy experiment. Blanks the microscopes PMTs during the laser turnaround, offers another trigger with user chosen offset time to gate the stimulus. Microsecond precision, in our case used at the 12kHz resonant scanner of a mesoscope.
